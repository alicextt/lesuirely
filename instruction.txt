For Git:
1. Use git pull before writing code.
2. To commit code:
git add —-all
git commit -m “message”
git push
Then you can check the status.

For MAMP (MAC version, windows might be different):
put the project in /Application/MAMP/htdocs
The URL is http://localhost:8888/lesuirely/index.php
The port number is 8888, this can be changed on the setting of MAMP.

Turn error on: go to bin/php/php-latest/ conf/ php.ini
